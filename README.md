# Crypto Tax Calculator

## Description & Motivation

Parses coinbase csvs to calculate P&L on crypto transactions using the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) method.

Because coinbase's csv export is not compatible with Turbotax.  See:

- [Coinbase CSV tax doesnâ€™t work with Turbo Tax?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/kwbw3w/coinbase_csv_tax_doesnt_work_with_turbo_tax/)
- [Coinbase csv file not compatible on turbotax? No Headers Found In This File error?](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/taxes/discussion/coinbase-csv-file-not-compatible-on-turbotax-no-headers-found-in-this-file-error/00/1820285)

## How to run

1. Download the release for your CPU architecture & operating system type from the [this project's releases page](https://github.com/sklarsa/crypto-taxes/releases)
2. Optionally rename the file (the rest of the examples use `crypto-taxes` as the name of the executable)
3. (Mac OSX Only) Find the executable in the Finder, right-click it and select "Open" to bypass OSX's overly-cautious security features
4. In the terminal, navigate to the directory of the executable and run the following command:

    ```bash
    # Change file permissions to allow execution
    $ chmod 740 crypto-taxes

    # Run the file on a downloaded csv from Coinbase.  The -csv flag outputs a valid csv to stdout.
    ./crypto-taxes -csv your-coinbase-file.csv
    ```
